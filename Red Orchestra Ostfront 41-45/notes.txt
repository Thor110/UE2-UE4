RO-BaksanValley - won't load

RO-GÃ¶rlitz one missing asset on load

UCC Doesn't have batchexport for the sounds

No texture files

Animations & StaticMeshes good.

UE4 T3Ds not edited for importing yet

Maps contain files Umodel cannot access

EngineDefault package missing?

Textures & StaticMeshes are missing because of the last two notes which means the T3Ds cannot be auto-corrected by the current batch file

Sort the contents of Extracted Maps Folders

RO-Danzig map fails to extract some files
Exporting StaticMesh board to C:/umodel_win32/UmodelExport/RO-Danzig/Buildings/board.pskx

Only three sound packages contain files but they contain files intended for the other packages which are exported to the correct folders
