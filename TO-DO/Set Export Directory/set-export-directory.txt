set-export-directory.bat

read the export directory from umodel.cfg

so that if the user has manually set their umodel export directory it will still be right.

ExportPath = "C:\umodel_win32\UmodelExport\"

and set

SaveGroups = true

or just temporarily replace umodel.cfg

rename umodel.cfg to umodel.tmp

write the new umodel.cfg to umodel directory
